# Releasing zskills

This file documents the dev→prod release pipeline. It is stripped from the
public mirror by `scripts/build-prod.sh` — you shouldn't see this on
`github.com/zeveck/zskills`.

## TL;DR

1. Click **🚀 Ship to Prod** in the README (or go to Actions → "🚀 Ship to Prod" → Run workflow).
2. Leave "Dry run" unchecked. Click **Run workflow**.
3. ~1–2 min later, `github.com/zeveck/zskills` has the new release plus a matching tag on both repos.

## One-time setup

The workflow pushes to `github.com/zeveck/zskills` using a personal access
token stored as a secret in this repo.

1. **Create a fine-grained PAT** at <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new>:
   - **Resource owner**: your account (same one that owns both repos).
   - **Repository access**: Only select repositories → `zeveck/zskills`.
   - **Permissions → Repository permissions**:
     - **Contents**: Read and write
     - **Metadata**: Read (auto)
   - Expiration: whatever you want (90 days default is fine; rotate when it expires).
2. **Add it as a repo secret** in this (dev) repo:
   - Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.
   - Name: `PROD_PUSH_TOKEN`
   - Value: paste the PAT.
3. Done. The workflow will pick it up automatically.

The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` (scoped to this repo) handles tagging dev and
creating the release — no extra setup needed for that side.

## What the workflow does

On dispatch, it:

1. Checks out the current dev HEAD (full history, so it can enumerate tags).
2. Runs `bash tests/run-all.sh` as a gate. Any red test aborts the release.
3. Computes the next tag as `YYYY.MM.N` where `N` is the count of existing
   tags matching `YYYY.MM.*` (zero-indexed — first release of a month is
   `.0`, second is `.1`, etc.).
4. Runs `scripts/build-prod.sh` to strip dev-only artifacts from the working
   tree (see that file's header for the full list of transforms).
5. Writes the stripped tree as a new commit with `prod/main` as its parent,
   so prod ends up with a linear history of release snapshots.
6. Pushes the stripped commit to `prod/main`, pushes the computed tag to
   both dev and prod, and creates a GitHub Release on dev with
   auto-generated notes from the last tag.

## Who can release

Only collaborators with Write access to this (dev) repo. The repo is public,
so anyone can *see* the Actions tab, but random visitors cannot trigger the
workflow.

## Dry run

If you changed `scripts/build-prod.sh` and want to verify the transforms
without actually shipping: click Run workflow, check **Dry run**, run. The
workflow will build the prod tree and show the file diff in the run
summary, but will not push anything or tag anything.

## Adding new transforms

Extend `scripts/build-prod.sh`. Common candidates:

- Strip additional dev-only dirs (`plans/`, `reports/`, `tests/`, etc. — none
  currently stripped, since they're small and useful for readers of the prod
  source. Revisit if they grow.)
- Rewrite dev-only links in other markdown files by adding
  `<!-- prod-strip:start --> … <!-- prod-strip:end -->` around them and
  calling `strip_markers <file>` in build-prod.sh.
- Mark a skill as dev-only by adding `dev_only: true` to its SKILL.md
  front-matter — no script change needed, already honored.

Run the workflow in dry-run mode after any build-prod.sh change.

## Recovering from a bad release

Because prod's main is always built on top of the previous prod/main (not
force-pushed), a bad release leaves a bad commit at HEAD. To recover:

- Simplest: ship a new release with the fix. Prod's main advances forward.
- If the bad release must be expunged entirely, you'll need to force-push
  prod/main manually (locally, authenticated as a prod collaborator) and
  delete the bad tag from both repos. The workflow intentionally does not
  automate this — expunging history should be rare and deliberate.

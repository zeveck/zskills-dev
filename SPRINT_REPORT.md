# Sprint Report

## Sprint — 2026-04-03 17:30 [FINALIZED 2026-04-04]

**Mode:** auto | **Focus:** default

### Fixed

(none)

### Skipped — Too Complex (need /run-plan)

| # | Title | Why |
|---|-------|-----|
| #1 | zskills assumes bash/node is installed | Cross-platform hook strategy requires architectural decisions (rewrite hooks without bash/node/jq dependency, or document requirements, or add runtime detection with fallbacks). Not a batch-fix item. Consider `/draft-plan` for #1. |

No actionable issues found (1 open, 1 skipped as too complex). Sprint complete with no fixes.
